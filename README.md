    1. Create a new [request token](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/create-request-token) by inserting your API key into the `api_key` field on the "Try it out" tab
    1. Make sure to allow your account writing-access to that request token by following the url  `https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{place-your-request-token-here}`
    1. Create a new [Session ID](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/create-session) by going to the "Try it out" tab, insert your API key into the `api_key` field and insert your _request token_ into the **Request Body** json, so:

      "request_token": "place-your-request-token-here"
    }
    ```
